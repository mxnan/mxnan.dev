This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

```tsx
//get formatted time
export const getFormattedPublishedAt = (publishedAt: string) => {
  const now = dayjs();
  const publishedAtDate = dayjs(publishedAt);

  const diffYears = now.diff(publishedAtDate, "year");
  const diffMonths = now.diff(publishedAtDate, "month");
  const diffWeeks = now.diff(publishedAtDate, "week");
  const diffDays = now.diff(publishedAtDate, "day");

  if (diffYears >= 1) {
    return `${diffYears} years ago`;
  } else if (diffMonths >= 1) {
    return `${diffMonths} months ago`;
  } else if (diffWeeks >= 1) {
    return `${diffWeeks} weeks ago`;
  } else if (diffDays >= 1 && diffDays < 7) {
    return `${diffDays} days ago`;
  } else {
    return publishedAtDate.format("MMMM D, YYYY");
  }
};
```
